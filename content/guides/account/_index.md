## Change your password

To change your password, execute the `appclacks account password change` CLI command.

It will ask you for your account email, current password, and new password.

If you forgot your password, you can run `appclacks account password send-reset-link --email <your-account-email>`. You'll receive a reset link in your email that will redirect you to a page to reset your password.
