      <description>The Appclacks CLI can be used to manage health checks
How health checks are executed You can choose when you create an health check if it should be executed or not by the Appclacks cloud platform.
It&amp;rsquo;s possible to create health checks on Appclacks but to host yourself the prober executing the health check, or to execute it by both Appclacks and on your infrastructure. See the Appclacks on your private infrastructure guide for more information about self-hosting.</description>

      <description>Cabourotte, the Appclacks prober, is a free software you can host on your private infrastructure.
It can be retrieved from its Github repository and its documentation is available on https://www.cabourotte.appclacks.com/.
You should configure the discovery section of the Cabourotte configuration file to integrate it with Appclacks. Cabourotte will retrieve the health check configurations from Appclacks and run the health checks.
This is a Cabourotte configuration example:
http: host: &amp;#34;0.0.0.0&amp;#34; port: 9013 discovery: http: - name: &amp;#34;appclacks&amp;#34; interval: 60s host: &amp;#34;api.</description>
